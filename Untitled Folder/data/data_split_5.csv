content "WASHINGTON  —   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit  which challenges the administration’s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans  handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode  leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome  Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law  angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist  Donald J. Trump’s administration  worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives  could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup  Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit  which  after the election  has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. “Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress  it would be inappropriate to comment ” said Phillip J. Blando  a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. “Upon taking office  the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. ” In a potentially   decision in 2015  Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies  in violation of the Constitution  without approval from Congress. The Justice Department  confident that Judge Collyer’s decision would be reversed  quickly appealed  and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won  House Republicans last month told the court that they “and the  ’s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter  to take effect after the  ’s inauguration on Jan. 20  2017. ” The suspension of the case  House lawyers said  will “provide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. ” Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of “cascading effects” if the   payments  which have totaled an estimated $13 billion  are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all  the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  ’s dim view of the health care law  a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request  the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case “will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions  as well as for the nation’s health insurance and health care systems generally. ” No matter what happens  House Republicans say  they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse  and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies  as required by the Constitution. In the suit  which was initially championed by John A. Boehner  the House speaker at the time  and later in House committee reports  Republicans asserted that the administration  desperate for the funding  had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010  and that no annual appropriation was required  —   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans  Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  —   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  —   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing  the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care "After the bullet shells get counted  the blood dries and the votive candles burn out  people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx  just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction  still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the city’s efforts to fight it remain splintered  underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct  at the southern tip of the Bronx  as in other poor  minority neighborhoods across the country  people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September  four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the city’s 77 precincts  the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime  reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan  according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends  even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx  investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the city’s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The borough’s robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan’s  even though the Bronx has had 1  300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders  compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In   lobbies and   family apartments  outside methadone clinics and art studios  people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors  more fearful of a gunman’s crew than confident in the Police Department’s ability to protect them. So though people see a lot  they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx  as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States  the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored  or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller’s arrest  or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics  like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White  who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer  four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project  ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras  lights  locks  investigating police officers. “Here  we have nothing ” she said. When it comes to “  families ” she said  the authorities “don’t really care as much. That’s how I feel. ” The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct  one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City. The homicides  —   14 in the precinct this year  up from nine in 2015  —   strain detectives  and when they go unsolved  as half of them have this year  some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends  witnesses and police officers  the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes  mental illness  drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers’ view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution  victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives’ phones rarely ring with tips  and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime  a victim’s friends conduct their own investigations  and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother’s apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community  gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews’ threats  and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Mary’s Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles  empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market  slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars  flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez  40  asked the young men to move  they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime  an anachronism in much of New York  still rattles the 40th Precinct  even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country  and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side  he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life  he got a tech maintenance job and  three years ago  moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter  now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch  or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again  he walked into a local substation  Police Service Area 7  and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. “There’s a lot of killers here  and we are going to kill you ” a sergeant’s police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him  “I’m going to shoot through your window. ” Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers’ names  which appear in the reports  and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation  and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later  the same    propped his bike on their door  “then said if I was to open the door and say something  they would body slam me ” Mr. Fernandez’s wife  Maria Fernandez  wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to “slap” her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale  and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because “they are the ones snitching ” her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation  10 days after the first  brought no relief. A week later  feeling desperate  Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation  at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her  and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came  she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next  but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said  making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later  she said  when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s  still very much present to some of the precinct’s residents. Around 6:30 each morning  Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk  —   dead bodies with no known cause  strip club brawls  shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves  —   bring resistance at every turn  reminding him of an earlier era in the city’s   campaign. “I haven’t got one single phone call that’s putting me in the right direction here ” said Sergeant LoPuzzo  the head of the precinct’s detective squad  one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim’s aunt about why the killer had not been caught. “And people just don’t understand that. ” Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September  more than a third  —   66 victims  —   refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct  squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings  and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics  like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner  Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the    strategy  in 2012  the 40th Precinct had the   stops in the city  the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18  276 stops that year  15  521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls  they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark  even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. “I need to bring something in today to justify my existence ” Officer Argenis Rosado  who joined the precinct in 2010  said in an interview at the station house. “So now you’re in a small area  and day after day you’re hammering the same community. Of course that community’s eventually going to turn on you. ” The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. “Some of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently  too ” said Hector Espada  a   veteran of the precinct. “Not because they wanted to  but because they had to. Because some way or somehow  you can’t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. ” Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue  in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain  and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year  one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years  one of them after officers were found to be “ticket fixing ” or forgiving parking tickets for friends  and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men  ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units  like   that put them in   situations on the street. “Whenever I walked through the doors of the precinct  to me  it seemed like a black cloud ” said Russell Lewis  a    of the 40th. “It was like a heaviness. When you walked in  all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home  because you didn’t want to get caught up in anything. ” The precinct covers only about two square miles  but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1  300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism  officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift  —   a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner  James P. O’Neill  said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem  it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year  the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city  and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer  Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January  part of a citywide effort under Mr. O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop  unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call  who can listen to people’s concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city  and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school  on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street  that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights  Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. “That perception really sticks ” he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx  Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinct’s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year  and many others have loads in the high 300s  even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide  they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    —   murders  rapes  felony assaults and robberies. By contrast  a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32  the citywide median. Last year  the 40th was the    for violent crime  with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole  a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year  compared with 27 in Manhattan  37 in Brooklyn  38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units  but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims  write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan  which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx  often have more property felonies  like stolen laptops or credit cards  and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes  the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino  the head of the Detectives’ Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer  said staffing disparities affected the department’s efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation  he said: “If I cooperate with the detectives  there’s so much work  there’s so few of them there  they won’t even get the chance to protect me  or they’ll be there too late when the retaliation comes. ” Sergeant LoPuzzo  who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct  said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had  and that while every squad wanted more detectives  staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. “We fight with the army we have  not the army we wish we had ” he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36  000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux  and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The Times’s analysis of confidential staffing data  the department’s chief of detectives  Robert K. Boyce  vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang  narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies  gangs or grand larcenies  for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct  at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001  even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinct’s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years  according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park  where crime dropped by a third over that period  grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer  when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city’s last “” the busiest precincts. Rather  they say  the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. “Any crime in Manhattan has to be solved ” said Howard Landesberg  who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. “The outer boroughs are  like  forgotten. ” Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx  Brooklyn and Queens  where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year  compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx  42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last year’s homicides  detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan  63 percent in the Bronx  62 percent in Queens  57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. “It’s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan ” said Joseph L. Giacalone  a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad  in part “because that’s where the money is. ” He added: “When de Blasio came in  he talked about the tale of two cities. And then he’s done the complete opposite of what he said. It’s just business as usual. ” The Bronx’s struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years  prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well  but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyn’s rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct  which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated  said Patrice O’Shaughnessy  a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney’s office. The district attorney  Darcel D. Clark  elected in 2015  said in a statement  “I was a judge here in the Bronx  and I heard from jurors that they can’t be impartial because they don’t trust the police. ” Against that tide of mistrust  Sergeant LoPuzzo’s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son’s ashes in a box. In the months after a killing  they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precinct’s homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist’s help. Victims’ families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts  pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy   squad room  the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled  or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison  looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective  Jeff Meenagh  said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would “get what you deserve. ” The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a woman’s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name  —   about a gun under a car  for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But James Fernandez  in the Betances Houses  said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October  Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  —   and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door  so they could get in whenever they wanted  showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisor’s permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building  causing the young men to scatter  but did not come inside  Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandez’s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed  and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president  Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victim’s advocate in the district attorney’s office. On Oct. 20  2015  he sent an online note to the police commissioner’s office. “We went to all proper channels for help ” the note said. “Both precincts failed us  except 2 officers who helped us  but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. ” “40th and PSA 7 won’t do anything ” he wrote  referring to the local substation. “Please we need to speak to some one with authority. ” The local substation commander  Deputy Inspector Jerry O’Sullivan  and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly  but it returned after the young men rented a room in a woman’s apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway  Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later  the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses  who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests  for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. “I have no faith in the City of New York  I have no faith in the police  I have no faith in the politicians ” Mr. Fernandez said. “The only thing I know for sure: God  if we’re in a situation again  I will be left to defend my family. ” Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway  Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere  he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. “I’m bending over backward  and nobody’s not even doing anything ” he said. “Why am I going to help you  if you ain’t going to help me?” By last January  a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses  and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command  Inspector O’Sullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult  but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. “No one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived  with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment ” he said. Mr. Fernandez’s complaints did not spur any arrests  but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them  whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report  was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd  court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May 2017.0 1.0 "When Walt Disney’s “Bambi” opened in 1942  critics praised its spare  haunting visual style  vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the film’s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist  who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to “Bambi ” which remains a   mark for film animation  would not be widely known for decades. Like the film’s title character  the artist  Tyrus Wong  weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  —   and  in the hope of making a life in America  incarceration  isolation and rigorous interrogation  —   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed  he endured poverty  discrimination and chronic lack of recognition  not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art  before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist  painter  printmaker  calligrapher    illustrator and  in later years  maker of fantastical kites  he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject  he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition  when Mr. Wong did find it  was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation  professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter  Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934  his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso  Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s  he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings  as detailed as any architectural illustrations  that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios  among them “The Sands of Iwo Jima” (1949) “Rebel Without a Cause” (1955) and “The Wild Bunch” (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked  it was for “Bambi” that Mr. Wong was  —   belatedly  —   most renowned. “He was truly involved with every phase of production ” John Canemaker  an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University  said in an interview for this obituary in March. “He created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. ” In 2013 and 2014  Mr. Wong was the subject of “Water to Paper  Paint to Sky ” a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museum’s windows  which overlook San Francisco Bay  he could contemplate Angel Island  where more than nine decades earlier  as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25  1910  in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child  he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920  seeking better economic prospects  Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States  leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  —   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a “paper son”  —   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur  the act  which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country  was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906  an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents  including birth and immigration records  were destroyed  many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss  maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens  they were entitled to bring over their relatives  —   or  in the case of Gen Yeo and his father  “paper sons” posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception  United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately  and the answers had to match. For the new arrival  a major mistake  or a series of smaller ones  could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing  aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30  1920  after a month at sea  the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. “Angel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast ” Lisa See  the author of “On Gold Mountain” (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family  said in an interview in 2016. However  she continued: “The goal was really very different than Ellis Island  which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. ” Because Mr. Wong’s father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get  he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival  Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month  the only child among the immigrants being held there. “I was scared half to death I just cried ” Mr. Wong recalled in “Tyrus ” an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom  which premiered in 2015. “Every day is just miserable  —   miserable. I hated that place. ” On Jan. 27  1921  in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer  young Gen Yeo  posing as Look Tai Yow  was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento  where he joined his father  a schoolteacher Americanized “Tai Yow” to “Tyrus ” and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward  father and son were separated once more  when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time  he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  —   possibly more  —   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father  who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school  Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families  earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father  who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high  a teacher  noting his drawing talent  arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school  Tyrus found his calling at the institute  now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  —   a small fortune  —   to let him stay on as Otis’s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years  simultaneously working as the school janitor  before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died  leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938  Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration  creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends  including the   artist Benji Okubo  he founded the Oriental Artists’ Group of Los Angeles  which organized exhibitions of members’ work  —   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong  newly married and needing steady work  joined Disney in 1938 as an “” creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios  and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact  first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  ’s job itself: Painstaking  repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  —   “a terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter ” Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s  when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting “Bambi  a Life in the Woods ” the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book  Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ” a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  —   every petal on every flower  every leaf on every tree  —   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for “Bambi ” it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. “I said  ‘Gee  this is all outdoor scenery ’” he recalled in a video interview years afterward  adding: “I said  ‘Gee  I’m a landscape painter! ’” Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 —  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody  lyrical and atmospheric  —   at once lush and spare  —   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. “Walt Disney went crazy over them ” said Mr. Canemaker  who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book “Before the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists” (1996). “He said  ‘I love this indefinite quality  the mysterious quality of the forest. ’” Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. “But he was more than that ” Mr. Canemaker explained. “He was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color  about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings  he inspired people. ” Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of “Bambi. ” Throughout the finished film  —   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty  desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  —   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941  in the wake of a bitter employees’ strike that year  Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  —   he felt the studio had been good to him  Mr. Canemaker said  —   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On “Bambi ” Mr. Wong’s name appears  quite far down in the credits  as a mere “background” artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942  working there  —   and lent out on occasion to other studios  —   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house  he and his wife  the former Ruth Kim  were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. “Then in a month you’d go back there and the sign was still there ” Mr. Wong recalled in “Tyrus. ” After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941  Mr. Wong  like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage  lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental Artists’ Group. Mr. Wong’s friend Mr. Okubo was sent  with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. “If World War II hadn’t happened when it did  I think these artists  even the   artists  would have more of a name than they do today ” Ms. See said. “And that’s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. ” Mr. Wong  who became a United States citizen in 1946  also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware  now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland  Calif. he became  in retirement  a renowned kitemaker  designing  building and hand coloring astonishing  airworthy creations  —   butterflies  swallows  whole flocks of owls  centipedes more than 100 feet long  —   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth Wong’s life  when she was ill with dementia  Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995  he slowly began making art again. In 2001  in formal recognition of his influence on “Bambi ” Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  —   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray  Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  —   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003  a retrospective of his work  curated in part by Ms. See  was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family Museum’s retrospective  “Water to Paper  Paint to Sky ” traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America  in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Wong’s death  at his home in Sunland  was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters  Kay Fong    Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small  Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art  as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained  he said
